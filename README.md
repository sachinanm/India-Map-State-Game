## Introduction 🌟

India States Game is a Python project that offers an interactive and educational gaming experience. The game challenges players to identify the names of various states in India. Utilizing the `turtle` module, it presents a graphical interface that enhances user engagement.

## Coordinates of States 🗺️

Coordinates of states in India are obtained using the `mouse_click_coords` function. Clicking on the map displays the coordinates (in pixels) of the clicked point, which can be used for various interactive features.

The `turtle` module provides a simple way to interact with graphics, making it ideal for educational games and interactive applications. By understanding and utilizing the mouse click coordinates, you can enhance the India States Game and create engaging visual experiences for the users. Happy coding! 😄


## How to Play 🎯

1. The game displays a map of India with the states outlined.
2. Players input the name of a state when prompted.
3. If the answer is correct, the state name is marked as guessed on the map.
4. The game continues until all 29 states are correctly guessed.
